This project focuses on cyber attack detection using advanced machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. Employing a rigorous evaluation process, we determined that the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model exhibited the highest accuracy among the tested algorithms.
